# SSeth's Quote Machine

## Made for FreeCodeCamp challenge below:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

Main goals for me:
Finish functional app with React + Bootstrap

### What I want to learn:

- Proper prop drilling (this is small project, useContext will be overkill)
- Random generation of entries
- Maybe a little animation here and there to avoid stale look
- Styling and general handling CSS in React
- Uploading page to the web for the whole world to see (netlify/github pages or something else)
